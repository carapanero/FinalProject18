# Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2018

Description of Game: This is a classic game of tic-tac-toe. Player one is asked where they would like to place an "X" and they chose the
number that coordinates the spot they would like to select. Player two then recieves the same option. If either player picks a spot that
was previously chosen, an error message is displaced. The computer checks, in between rounds, to see if someone won or if there is a tie.
